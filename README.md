This application allows you to enter one of four commands. The commands are concert-this, movie-this, spotify-this-song, and do-what-it-says. The first three commands are followed by either a band who is currently touring, a movie, or a song. Then using API's from Bandisintown, OMDb and Spotify information is generated for each command and search term. The do-what-it-says command reads a .txt file with a command a search term to do give the information from that search.
